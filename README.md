# Challenging Fake Image Detection using GAN Models
In today's digital age, the rapid advancement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has made it increasingly challenging to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images. The primary purpose of this project is to develop a robust and effective fake image detection system capable of differentiating between authentic images and those generated by GAN models.

DATASET:
  140k Real and Fake Faces
70k real faces (from Flickr) and 70k fake faces (GAN-generated)
This dataset consists of all 70k REAL faces from the Flickr dataset collected by Nvidia and 70k fake faces sampled from the 1 Million FAKE faces (generated by StyleGAN) that Bojan provided.
In this dataset, all the images are resized into 256px, and the data is split into train, validation and test sets.
