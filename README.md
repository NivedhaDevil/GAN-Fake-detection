# GAN-Fake-detection
In today's digital age, the rapid advancement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has made it increasingly challenging to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images. The primary purpose of this project is to develop a robust and effective fake image detection system capable of differentiating between authentic images and those generated by GAN models.
